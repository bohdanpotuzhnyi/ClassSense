## Teacher prototype

We created two dashboard layouts: a compact status bar and a full-screen dashboard. Interactive Figma prototypes were 
implemented.

## Student prototype

We first sketched both concepts as paper prototypes. Then we implemented both variants in Figma to validate tap
targets, layout, and visual calmness. Two interaction variants were developed:

- **Buttons:** one-tap input for four states (OK, confused, overloaded, tired).
- **Sliders:** more nuanced expression, but higher precision and attention demands.
