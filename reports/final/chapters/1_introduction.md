## Background

Swiss high schools are undergoing a significant transformation through the reform “Weiterentwicklung der gymnasialen Maturität” (WEGM). 
The reform emphasizes digital competence, media literacy, and self-regulated learning, and it further strengthens the teacher’s role as a facilitator 
of learning and classroom climate [@movetia2024wegm; @edk2024rlp]. As digital devices become integral to everyday teaching, teachers face new challenges: 
maintaining attention, managing distractions, and supporting students’ emotional and cognitive well-being.

## Problem

In BYOD classrooms, students’ faces and micro-cues are often partially hidden behind screens. Teachers report relying on indirect indicators 
(participation, posture, general noise) which become less reliable when devices are open. Research suggests that classroom emotional climate 
relates strongly to engagement and adjustment [@brackett2011classroom; @wang2020classroom; @reyes2012classroom], yet most schools still rely 
on teachers’ intuition to notice when a class drifts out of sync.

ClassSense addresses this gap by providing a lightweight, privacy-respecting feedback loop that supports co-regulation in real time, without monitoring or identifying individuals.

## Goals

ClassSense was designed around four goals:

- Real-time awareness: show an anonymous, aggregated distribution of student states (e.g., OK, confused, overloaded, tired) to support timely pedagogical adjustments.
- Low interaction effort: keep student input to a single tap so participation is feasible during class activities.
- Privacy-by-design: no logins, no personal identifiers, no individual histories; only session-level, aggregated state information.
- Low teacher workload: “off-the-shelf” setup and a teacher view that can stay in peripheral vision without interrupting teaching.

## Methodological approach

We followed an iterative user-centered design process:

1. Exploratory study (questionnaires + interviews) to understand constraints and derive requirements.
2. Persona/scenario modeling to keep design decisions anchored in realistic classroom contexts.
3. Prototyping (paper + Figma + functional prototype) to validate interaction concepts early.
4. Controlled evaluation comparing student input styles (buttons vs. sliders) and teacher dashboard setups (browser vs. external screen).
