Based on the exploratory study, we defined teacher and student personas and short scenarios to keep design decisions grounded in realistic classroom contexts.

## Teacher personas

**Mr. Müller (42, History/English, BYOD class)**  
Pain points: cannot read the class once everyone looks at laptops; “Is the pace ok?” often yields silence; constant micro-adjustments are exhausting.  
Motivations: act early before the group drifts; feedback must not expose individual students; tool should run quietly.  
Design implications: aggregated, glanceable teacher view; actionable hints; privacy guarantee visible.

**Mrs. Brinkmann (28, Mathematics/Physics)**  
Pain points: multitasking on screens reduces engagement; wants evidence beyond intuition.  
Motivations: understand engagement across lesson phases; improve pacing and materials.  
Design implications: optional post-lesson summary; keep real-time view minimal for in-lesson use.

**Mr. Zemp (58 years old, Languages)**  
Pain points: feels saturated with new tools; fears student misuse or extra workload.
Motivations: willing to try if privacy and simplicity are guaranteed.
Design implications: onboarding must take under 3 minutes; use neutral visual design and clear labels; highlight “no extra admin work.”


## Student personas

**Melanie (17, organised, grade-oriented)**  
Wants efficient pacing and clarity; needs an “OK/continue” option so the class doesn’t always slow down.

**Tim (16, introverted, slow processing)**  
Avoids asking publicly; needs anonymous one-tap signals for “too fast” or “overloaded”, plus a simple confirmation that input was counted.

**Jasmin (17, avoids attention)**  
Wants a collective signal when many are tired or lost; insists on no personal trace.

**Phil (16, digitally fluent, easily bored)**  
Needs short check-ins and low-friction interaction; interface should feel modern but minimal.

## Scenarios

**Scenario 1 – Live regulation:** students tap icons; teacher sees overload rising and pauses briefly; the next pulse shows recovery, reinforcing trust.  
**Scenario 2 – Energy monitor in a double period:** increased tiredness triggers a micro-break and short pair task; attention returns without disciplinary interventions.  
**Scenario 3 – Post-lesson review:** an anonymous timeline highlights phases of overload/fatigue; teacher adjusts next lesson structure accordingly.
