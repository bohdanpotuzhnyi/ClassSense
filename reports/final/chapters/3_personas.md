## Teacher personas

Based on the exploratory questionary and interview results, we have defined 3 teacher personas, 4 student personas and 3 scenarios. 
These objects will provide the ideas that will be later used in the prototype development.

**Mr. Müller (42 years old, History/English, BYOD class)**  

- Pain points: cannot read the class once everyone looks at laptops; asks “Is the pace ok?” and gets silence; feels tired managing constant micro-adjustments.
- Motivations: wants to act early before the group drifts; wants feedback that does not expose individual students; wants a tool that runs quietly in the background.
- Design implications: teacher view must be simple, aggregated, and readable at a glance; needs immediate hints for action (“slow down,” “pause”); privacy guarantee visible on the first screen.

**Mrs. Brinkmann (28 years old, Mathematics/Physics)**  

- Pain points: multitasking on screens reduces engagement; wants evidence beyond intuition.
- Motivations: understand engagement across lesson phases; improve pacing and materials.
- Design implications: optional post-lesson summary; keep real-time view minimal for in-lesson use.

**Mr. Zemp (58 years old, Languages)**  

- Pain points: feels saturated with new tools; fears student misuse or extra workload.
- Motivations: willing to try if privacy and simplicity are guaranteed.
- Design implications: onboarding must take under 3 minutes; use neutral visual design and clear labels; highlight “no extra admin work.”


## Student personas

**Melanie (17 years old, organized, grade-oriented)**

- Pain points: gets frustrated when the class slows down; does not want others’ disengagement to waste time.
- Motivations: wants efficient pacing and clarity.
- Design implications: needs “OK / continue” option to express readiness; system must show that feedback from all sides balances the group.

**Tim (16 years old, introverted, slow processing)**  

- Pain points: feels anxious when the teacher moves on too fast; avoids asking publicly for help.
- Motivations: wants a safe way to signal “too fast” or “overloaded.”
- Design implications: one-tap anonymous input required; a system must confirm receipt (“Your input counted”).

**Jasmin (17 years old, avoids attention)**  

- Pain points: feels invisible; sees teacher unaware of general tiredness.
- Motivations: wants collective expression (“many of us are tired”).
- Design implications: aggregated results must be visible to teachers only; no personal trace of participation.

**Phil (16 years old, digitally fluent, easily bored)**  

- Pain points: bored quickly; task repetition triggers distraction.
- Motivations: wants variety and quick feedback loops.
- Design implications: short check-ins maintain re-engagement; interface should feel modern but minimal.


## Scenarios

**Scenario 1 – Live regulation** 

1.	During a maths lesson, students tap icons: 30% “too fast”, 50% “OK”, 20% “tired.”
2.	Teacher view flashes amber: “Overload rising.”
3.	Teacher pauses 2 minutes, repeats the key step.
4.	The next pulse shows 70 percent “OK.”

Outcome: Teacher prevents frustration; students see reaction; trust is reinforced.

**Scenario 2 – Energy monitor in a double period** 

1.	After 45 minutes, many students signal “tired.”
2.	Teacher adds a micro-break and short pair task.
3.	Energy score returns to the green zone.
      
Outcome: Maintains attention without disciplinary interventions.

**Scenario 3 – Post-lesson review** 

1.	ClassSense shows to the teacher an anonymous timeline: first 20 min = OK, middle = over-load, last = fatigue.
2.	Teacher adjusts the next lesson by reducing input length and adding examples.
      
Outcome: Supports reflection without tracking individuals.
