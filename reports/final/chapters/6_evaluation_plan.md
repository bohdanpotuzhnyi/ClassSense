We conducted a within-subject controlled experiment to compare:

- Student input: **buttons** vs. **sliders**
- Teacher dashboard: **browser dashboard** vs. **external-screen dashboard**

## Theoretical basis

Interaction effort reduces the likelihood of frequent in-class feedback. Pointing and selection difficulty increases with precision and movement requirements [@fitts1954information], motivating the button-based design. For teachers, dashboards that require switching windows can interrupt instruction; external displays can support smoother task switching [@czerwinski2004diary].

## Hypotheses

**H1 (students):** A button-based UI will be rated higher in usability, be less disruptive, and be more readily adopted than a slider UI.  
**H1 (teachers):** A dashboard on a separate external screen will be rated as more practical and desirable to adopt than a browser-only dashboard.

## Experimental design

We used a within-subject design to reduce inter-individual variability. Condition order was counterbalanced (half A→B, half B→A).

### Participants (controlled experiment)

- Students: two secondary school classes (n = 26).
- Teachers: practising teachers (n = 7).

All participants used a BYOD setting. Due to hardware constraints, all trials used one shared setup (one sensor device and one external screen).

### Measurements

All subjective measures were collected via Microsoft Forms questionnaires using 5-point Likert scales (1 = strongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree). For each condition, we measured:

- Perceived usability
- Perceived disruptiveness / practicality in class
- Adoption intention

We also collected forced-choice preferences (which version would you use in class?) and logged reaction-time traces for student input.

### Procedure

**Students (~15 min):** introduction → condition 1 (with multiple prompts) → questionnaire → condition 2 → questionnaire → forced-choice preference.  
**Teachers (~15 min):** introduction → teach a short task with condition 1 → questionnaire → repeat with condition 2 → questionnaire → forced-choice preference.
